# Strudel Loops

This repository contains a few music loops that I wrote for **Strudel**.

To run a loop:

1. Open [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc)
2. Copy a loop from this repo into the online-editor
3. Click "play" or press **Ctrl/Cmd + Enter** to start it

A simple getting-started guide is available here:
